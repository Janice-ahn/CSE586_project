1. Before starting the test:
    - I followed this [LoRA Hugging Face instruction](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/training/lora).
    - I recommend you to follow the link except cloning their GitHub repo; start with:
      ```bash
      cd diffusers
      pip install .
      ```
    - if something doesn't work about the code, please consider removing diffusers directory and start with cloning their repo.
